                <h2>The definitive co-living experience</h2>
                <div class="sectionContent">
                    <p>Just an hour from Barcelona, hidden within Montseny Natural Park, Wonder House isn't your typical
                        co-living space, it's your new playground. Wonder House is all about spontaneous adventures,
                        unexpected friendships, and unforgettable moments. Here, you're not just renting a room; you're
                        joining an offbeat community that values connection, creativity, fun and the occasional trip
                        down the rabbit hole.
                    </p>

                <div class="sectionContent">
                    <p>At Wonder House, you can definitely get work done: there's plenty of space and quiet moments for
                        that. But life is so much more than that. Wonder House thrives on spontaneous hikes, quirky
                        games, themed parties you'll still talk about months later, and conversations around the bonfire
                        that go deep into the night.

                        Come for the place. Stay for the people. Leave with memories you'll never forget.</p>

            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Co-living? What the heck is that?</h3>
                <p>Think of co-living as the joyful antidote to our hyper-connected yet oddly disconnected world. Itâs a
                    lifestyle where people actually talk instead of text, cook together instead of ordering solo
                    takeout, and swap endless scrolling for epic adventures. Basically, it's about sharing a home with
                    amazing humans who might start as strangers but quickly become your tribe, creating friendships,
                    memories, and maybe even a little bit of delightful chaos along the way.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How big is the house and the community?</h3>
                <p>Wonder House has 9 rooms and can host up to 22 amazing humans, but usually, weâll keep it a bit more
                    intimate. The house itself is a massive rural masia, with enough shared spaces to lose yourself: 2
                    kitchens for culinary masterpieces, a 24/7 co-working zone, a cozy dining hall, a living room with a
                    fireplace, a cinema room for late-night marathons, 2 barbecue areas, a wild garden, a natural pool
                    for mermaid practice, a mini forest for secret missions... and a forbidden room weâll definitely
                    pretend doesnât exist</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>SWhat should I expect as a co-liver</h3>
                <p>This isnât a hotel, itâs a living, breathing madhouse of imperfect humans, so if you use a common
                    space, clean your mess. If the dishwasherâs screaming for help, save it.

                    Being in the countryside means you'll be vibing with bugs, frogs, and the occasional overly
                    ambitious mosquito. Spot a mouse? Blame the local cats: they unionized, demanded better working
                    conditions, and are currently on indefinite strike.

                    Weâve built the ultimate playground for magic to happen, but itâs up to <strong>you</strong> and
                    your fellow co-livers to bring it to life: organize wild games, sunrise hikes, karaoke battles, you
                    name it. There will be many things happening, but youâre always free to skip a few, hide away with a
                    book, and recharge your inner energy.

                    And if you hear unsettling sounds from the neighborâs house? Donât worry. Itâs just part of the
                    Wonder House folklore.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What does my stay at the Wonder House include?</h3>
                <p>Your stay comes with a cozy room/bed to call your own, full access to our common spaces (perfect for
                    spontaneous hangouts and hammock naps), daily activities to spark your spirit, endless outdoor
                    adventures, and a fast Wi-Fi for when you <strong>actually</strong> need to adult.

                    We host themed communal dinners from Monday to Friday (for a small extra fee), a daily excuse to
                    gather, feast, and connect like family. Trust us, you won't want to miss it.

                    Weâve also got you covered with fresh bed linen, fluffy towels, toilet paper, and a stash of kitchen
                    basics like coffee, tea, oil, and spices to fuel your creations. Laundryâs available too, for a tiny
                    extra charge.

                    Basically, you get everything you need to live, connect, and create some seriously unforgettable
                    moments.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do I get to the Wonder House?</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>By plane:</strong> Barcelona El Prat Airport is just 1h away by car. There's also a direct
                    train from the airport to Hostalric (the closest village) 2-3 times a day. We can pick you up from
                    the train station.
                    The closest Airport is Girona-Costa Brava Airport, which is 30 minutes away by car.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>By car:</strong> Just follow Google Maps: <a href="https://g.co/kgs/mjhDGdc">Wonder House
                        Coliving</a>, we are less than 1h away from Barcelona and you can park your car at the premises.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>By train:</strong> There are regular trains from Barcelona city center to the closest
                    village Hostalric (approximately every 2h and the train takes 1h) and a train from Barcelona Airport
                    to Hostalric 2-3 times a day. We will pick you up by car at the Hostalric train station, itâs a 10
                    min ride from there to the Wonder House.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Crawling:</strong> Lost a leg (or two) in the zombie apocalypse? No problem. It'll only take
                    you
                    around 60 hours to crawl your way to the Wonder House. Weâll be waiting at the door armed with axes,
                    chainsaws, and a hot cup of coffee.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What are the working conditions?</h3>
                <p>When duty calls (or your boss does), we've got your back: a 24/7 dedicated co-working space with
                    ergonomic chairs and beautiful views to keep the inspiration flowing. Prefer a more laid-back vibe?
                    Youâll find plenty of cozy nooks around the house, and even your room comes with its own desk for
                    those "do not disturb" moments. Our Wi-Fi covers the entire house and garden, with speeds over 100
                    Mbps for downloads and 10â20 Mbps for uploads. And if it ever lags... just shake your fist at the
                    sky and blame Elon Musk.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How do groceries work?</h3>
                <p>The nearest supermarkets are just a 10-minute drive away. We organize daring grocery quests 2-3 times
                    a week, and if you prefer the wizardry of the internet, you can summon your
                    supplies online right to our doorstep. For our epic communal dinners, weâll handle the necessary
                    ingredients, you just show up hungry and ready for the feast.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What is the minimum stay duration?</h3>
                <p>Our minimum stay is 1 month, because real connections donât happen overnight. It gives you
                    time to settle in, sync with the community vibe, and truly live the Wonder House experience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What is the cancellation policy?</h3>
                <p>We ask for 30% of the total amount when you book your stay. If life throws you a curveball and you
                    cancel more than 30 days before your arrival, no worries: youâll get a full refund. If you decide to
                    leave earlier once you're here, you'll be charged for the next 14 days (or less if your stay ends in
                    less than 14 days). Why? Because in a co-living space like this, every spot matters, and sudden
                    goodbyes leave a ripple in the community (plus, itâs hard to find a new adventurer on super short
                    notice).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What can I do around here?</h3>
                <p>Montseny Natural Park is basically your giant backyard, packed with endless hikes, secret gorges, and
                    if you're feeling very zen some good old-fashioned mushroom hunting. We're also just 30 minutes from
                    the Costa Bravaâs crystalline beaches, surrounded by charming villages, ancient castles, and enough
                    medieval fairs, witch festivals, and local markets to make you wonder what century you woke up in.

                    Need a city fix? Barcelonaâs just an hour away and Girona is even closer at 40 minutes. Oh, and if
                    youâre craving adrenaline: trail running, zipline parks, and via ferratas are basically calling your
                    name. Adventure, culture, and a little bit of magic, itâs all waiting for you.</p>

                <h3>I don't speak any Spanish or Catalan, is that a problem?</h3>
                <p>No problemo, amigo! English is the main language at the Wonder House, and we make sure everyoneâs in
                    the loop. If a conversation drifts into Spanish, Catalan, or Martian, we gently hit the "switch to
                    English" button so no one gets left out.</p>

                <h3>Are pets allowed?</h3>
                <p>Furry friends are welcome in the apartment for a small extra fee! Just a heads-up: we already have a
                    few unofficial, self-appointed garden guardians (a.k.a. the local cats) who like to chill in the sun
                    but politely keep their paws out of the house.</p>

                <h3>Can I come with children?</h3>
                <p>Not for now. Wonder House is currently an adults-only playground, partly because we host some
                    slightly wild, grown-up
                    activities that donât exactly scream "kid-friendly." We might revisit this policy in the future, but
                    for now, itâs all about the adults getting to be kids again.</p>
